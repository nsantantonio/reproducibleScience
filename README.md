## Reproducible Science

Welcome to my take on how one might use git and github as a way to (re)produce science. Here I will briefly present how to use several tools to build reproducible science projects. 

## Gold Standard

The gold standard for science, or a scientific manuscript rather, is for complete reproducability. I.e. another researcher should be able to reproduce your experiment exactly, given access to the correct starting materials. We know the outcomes will vary (vartiation due to sampling, environmental conditions, etc.), but the experimental design should be able to be replicated exactly. 

## A note on spreadsheets

Spreadsheets have their place. At one point in my career, I now use them regularly, although I generally abstain from any data manipulation 


## multiple collaborators

Git has awesome features for multiple people working on the same project. However, outside of software development (arguably what git was designed for), I have found little benefit to sharing git repositories outside of simply making everything publically available and having an official public version while I tinker locally.  

Internally, git can save you a lot of heartache through version control. Ever break a script and cant find the problem? You can either revert to an earlier version that worked or Overleaf, for example,
